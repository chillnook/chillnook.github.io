        Hey! My name is Daxen (aka ChillNook) and I’m a 17-year-old developer from Canada.
        I’ve been coding and programming for as long as I can remember. In 2016, I downloaded Pocket Code for
        the first time, which was a mobile knockoff of Scratch. I remember creating various simple projects there, which took
        up most of my time as a kid. I discovered I had an immense passion for creating and problem-solving, which led
        to me finding other forms of development.
      </p>

      <p>
        It wasn’t long after that I discovered Roblox. After learning how this new game worked and all of its mechanics,
        I wanted to create my own game on this new platform. I started trying to make games (which admittedly, weren’t very good),
        but through all that trial and error, it led to me becoming the proficient developer I am today. I’m not sure exactly
        how or why I discovered Roblox, but I’m more than grateful that I did.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve explored more platforms than Roblox over the years. I’ve experimented with Unity, GTA 5/FiveM modding,
        website programming, Minecraft mod and plugin programming, Discord bot programming, and more.
        I’m experienced in Lua, C#, C++, Java, and JavaScript outside of Roblox, and love programming in every one of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve worked on many projects over the years, none of which have ever really taken off, but some that I am most proud of
        include Summer Hotels, Sword Fight Simulator, and a new game I’m working on called Party Games. Outside of Roblox, I am
        also very proud of my Uber Driver Mod for GTA 5, which has gained a decent amount of traction and led me to work with a
        very big name in the gaming community!
      </p>

      <p>
        When it comes to my coding approach, I love finding the most efficient way to do things. I will work on something
        until I can solve it! (I’ve never been one to take many breaks, which has its pros and cons.) If something I make isn’t good enough,
        I will keep trying, or even start from scratch to ensure the best result that I can be proud of.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of the whole programming side of myself, I am very into creating and playing music, mechanical work, and anything hands-on.
        I find all of these things really fun and another way to spend my free time. In addition to my passion for creating, hands-on work
        has always been another passion of mine, as I love fixing stuff and improving upon what’s already been done.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the future, I’m planning to have bigger, more complex projects on the go (when I can afford to), and even have ambitions of starting
        my own business! In conclusion, my journey as a developer has been a fulfilling one, filled with exploration, learning, and creativity.
        From my early days with Pocket Code to working on various platforms and languages, I’ve cultivated a diverse skill set and a love for
        problem-solving. Each project, regardless of its success, has taught me valuable lessons and fueled my passion for development.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I look to the future, I’m excited about the potential for more ambitious projects and the opportunity to turn my dreams into reality,
        including the prospect of starting my own business. Programming, music, and hands-on work continue to inspire me, and I can’t wait to see
        where this journey takes me next.
