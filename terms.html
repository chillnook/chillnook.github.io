      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Services Provided</h2>
      <p>I offer custom programming/scripting services as a sole developer under the name Daxen (also known as Chill Nook). All work will be discussed, quoted, and agreed upon before the project begins. Services may include (but are not limited to): scripting systems, game mechanics, bug fixing, optimization, and consulting.</p>

      <p>Payment will be made upfront, partially upfront (with a milestone system), or upon completion, as agreed. Accepted payment method: PayPal. All payments will be discussed in USD or CAD. All prices and quotes are final unless otherwise negotiated before work starts. No refunds once work has begun, unless I am unable to complete the project.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Delivery & Revisions</h2>

Minor revisions (bug fixes, small adjustments) are free within a reasonable period after delivery (typically 7 days). Major revisions or additions not included in the original agreement may incur extra charges.</p>

I retain the right to showcase non-proprietary aspects of the work in my portfolio. Reselling, redistributing, or claiming the code as your own original work is not permitted unless explicitly agreed upon.</p>
